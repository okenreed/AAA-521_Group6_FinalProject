## Project Intro
In an era where managing space occupancy is crucial for both safety and efficiency, our
project embarks on solving a pertinent problem: accurately counting and monitoring the number
of people in designated regions of interest. This challenge, prevalent in scenarios ranging from
public events to private gatherings, demands a solution that is not only precise but also adaptable
to different environments. This solution offers a number of uses case capabilities.
- Monitor the count of people in various zones within a site and get predictable analytics
for customer arrival pattern
- Controlling maximum entry numbers in a particular area and thereby adhere to social
distancing guidelines
- Capture images/video for a customerâ€™s demographics or interest profile, their shopping
journey to get analytics
- Ability to understand busiest and quietest hours
- Set queue occupancy levels, no. of cash counters and measure customer billing/ service
time
- Set and receive alerts and/or notifications via audio, visual, email or text when these
capacity limits are approaching or reached
